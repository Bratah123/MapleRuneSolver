# MapleRuneSolver
A vision-based Rune solver, mostly used for Maplestory versions that have static arrow images.

## Important
- The script is assuming the last arrow to be right arrow all the time
  - Some v176 servers will have the last arrow always to be the `Right Arrow` (Blue)

## Installation
- Run the script, then click on the maplestory process while the rune is being used,
